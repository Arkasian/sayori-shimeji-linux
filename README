Shimeji for Linux 

I appreciate any bug reports or suggestions. Use the issue tracker here or contact me directly on IRC (Rizon) where I'm called 'asdfman'.
Future feature plans :
- Window layering detection, preventing interaction with non-visible objects, possibly treating overlapping windows as one big mass
- If you want window throwing and multi-shimeji support (Shimeji-EE style), let me know. I don't plan on using them myself at all and I'm not really convinced anyone else will either. 


CHANGELOG

v1.02
- Full functionality with all standard Behavior.xml and Actions.xml files. Feel free to use any Shimeji you find (make sure the config isn't a Shimeji-EE config though) and edit the files as you see fit.

v1.01
- All normal desktop windows should now be detected and interacted with correctly, titles.conf now defaults to an empty file.
- The mascots are now set a 'dock' window type property, using compton/xcompmgr with -C will not draw window shadows on them.

22.4.2012 v1.0
- Initial release, all basic functionality implemented

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. REQUIREMENTS

A compositing manager, Compton is highly recommended. 

Tested with both OpenJDK 6 and SunJDK 6 JRE's. There were some issues on Gnome and KDE when using OpenJDK, if you experience them the only solution I can offer for now is using Sun JRE, should solve all problems. 


2. USAGE

Obtain the repository :
git clone https://github.com/asdfman666/linux-shimeji.git OR download a zip archive on the github page

To run, execute launch.sh in the project root directory.

To build, just execute 'ant' in the project root directory.

Note that the program comes pre-compiled and you do not need to build unless you plan to modify the source.


3. CONFIGURATION 

window.conf - set window dimensions to match your window decorations. If you're using a plain WM with no decorations, zero on all values or an empty file should be accurate

titles.conf - enter window titles, one per line, case insensitive. The Mascots will interact with these windows only. If no window titles are specified, all windows will be interacted with. Leaving this file empty should be ideal for most people.

For more information refer to the configuration files. 


4. OBTAINING MORE SHIMEJIS

You can find thousands on www.deviantart.com and www.pixiv.net (tag: しめじ)

This version uses Japanese Actions.xml and Behavior.xml. There's a good chance you can use the images from a Shimeji with an English configuration file with good results aswell. The vast majority of available Shimejis have Japanese configuration files and will work perfectly fine.

To navigate your way through the .xml files more comfortably, I recommend using an english version of the file (from the Shimeji-EE project) as a roadmap (http://code.google.com/p/shimeji-ee/).
