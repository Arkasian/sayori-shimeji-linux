Shimeji for Linux 

I appreciate any bug reports or suggestions. Use the issue tracker here or contact me directly on IRC (Rizon) where I'm called 'asdfman'.
Future feature plans :
- Window layering detection, preventing interaction with non-visible objects, possibly treating overlapping windows as one big mass
- If you want window throwing and multi-shimeji support (Shimeji-EE style), let me know. I don't plan on using them myself at all and I'm not really convinced anyone else will either. 


CHANGELOG

v1.01
- All normal desktop windows should now be detected and interacted with correctly, titles.conf now defaults to an empty file.
- The mascots are now set a 'dock' window type property, using compton/xcompmgr with -C will not draw window shadows on them.

22.4.2012 v1.0
- Initial release, all basic functionality implemented

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. REQUIREMENTS

A compositing manager, Compton is highly recommended.  

Tested with both OpenJDK 6 and SunJDK 6 JRE's. There were some issues on Gnome and KDE when using OpenJDK, if you experience them the only solution I can offer for now is using Sun JRE, should solve all problems. 


2. USAGE

Obtain the repository :
git clone https://github.com/asdfman666/linux-shimeji.git OR download a zip archive on the github page

To run, execute launch.sh in the project root directory.

To build, just execute 'ant' in the project root directory.

Note that the program comes pre-compiled and you do not need to build unless you plan to modify the source.


3. CONFIGURATION 

window.conf - set window dimensions to match your window decorations. If you're using a plain WM with no decorations, zero on all values or an empty file should be accurate

titles.conf - enter window titles, one per line, case sensitive. The Mascots will interact with these windows only. If no window titles are specified, all windows will be interacted with. Leaving this file empty should be ideal for most people.

For more information refer to the configuration files. 


4. OBTAINING MORE SHIMEJIS

Default Shimejis with 46 images work best with this version . This covers the vast majority of Shimejis available on pixiv.net (tag : しめじ). You can try using heavily customized ones, they will most likely work, you'll just lose some functionality. EXTRA NOTE : Most Shimejis are 46-image default ones and will work perfectly fine with this version, just use the included config files and copy the images over.

Note on why they do not work : This version has simultaneous multiple window interaction unlike the original, which is limited to one window at a time (mascots will fall off it as soon as you unfocus). The config files needed to to be modified to add checks for all active windows so that the mascot can keep track of it's environment. This only affects the action selection so if you break the config files, the mascots will either stay still and wait when no action is available. 

To make a custom Actions.xml fully functional in this version, all jump action conditions with "activeIE" targeting the active window (3 in total) must be kept intact.

They are as follows : "IEの左に飛びつく" "IEの右に飛びつく" "IEの下に飛びつく"
After you've located them and ensured they stay intact, search and replace ALL occurences of "environment.activeIE" with "curIE" and you have a fully multi-window functional Actions.xml.

To navigate your way through the .xml files more comfortably, I recommend using an english version of the file (from the Shimeji-EE project) as a roadmap.

Altering the the default Behavior.xml is not recommended. If you encounter a non-default behavior file (and you're already using the Actions.xml that came with it), try to find the 'new' entrys and only add those, risk of breakage is extremely low that way.
